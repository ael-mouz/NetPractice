## Introduction
This project is a general practical exercise designed to help you discover networking concepts. It includes a series of 10 exercises that allow you to configure small-scale networks, providing hands-on experience in solving networking problems and making networks run efficiently.

## General Guidelines
In this project, you are required to complete 10 levels, each representing a different networking challenge. You will need to understand how TCP/IP addressing works to successfully configure these networks. The networks are not real but are available through a training interface accessible via a web browser.

## Mandatory Part
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Download the attached file from the projectâ€™s page.
2. Extract the files in a folder of your choice.
3. Run the `index.html` file. This will open the training interface in your web browser.

For detailed instructions, refer to [Chapter IV: Mandatory part](#mandatory-part) in the subject PDF.


## What I Learned
